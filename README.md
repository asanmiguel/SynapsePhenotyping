# SynapsePhenotyping
Code to accompany San Miguel et al. "Deep Phenotyping Unveils Hidden Traits and Genetic Relations  in Subtle Mutants "

The code presented here contains 4 zip files:
1)Vision&Support.zip
2)HTImaging.zip
3)Phenotyping.zip
4)LR_ModelCreation.zip


This code includes a graphical user interface used for high-throughput imaging and screening, code for synapse segmentation and phenotypic profiling (i.e., quantification of 76 different synaptic profiling metrics), as well as some support code for the above. In addition, the code used for creation of the step-wise logistic regression models that compare each mutant strain with wildtype is also included. A description of each is presented next:
